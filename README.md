# HololensPointRegistration
 a unity plugin for 3D-3D point registration

Isometric case is based on method in the paper Least-squares fitting of two 3-D point sets. IEEE T Pattern Anal 
by Arun et. al.

Anisometric case is adapted from matlab code in Iterative Solution for Rigid-Body Point-Based Registration with
Anisotropic Weighting by Balachadran et. al.

Current work in progress
